    "In this project, we have twelve characteristics of pumpkin seeds with 2 possible classifications. This data set includes 2500 pumpkin seeds with 1200 of “Ürgüp Sivrisi” and 1300 of “Çerçevelik” . Classification between the two types of pumpkin seeds is vital due to their role in the seed sector and is challenging to identify, therefore with our model, we will be able to sort through and classify between the 2 seed types.\n",
